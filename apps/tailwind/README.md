## Tailwind

Utility-first CSS framework

---

- ✅ Loads of atomic classes/utilities
- ✅ Very minimal setup - just PostCSS + Tailwind!
- ✅ Same utility classes across multiple projects
- ✅ Supports [@layer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@layer)
- ✅ Well documented

---

- ❌ Different syntax to css
- ❌ Sites can end up looking [same-y](https://tailwindcss.com/showcase) (it is possible to avoid this though!)
- ❌ Class names get long

---

- 🤑 Components are a [subscription](https://tailwindui.com/all-access)
