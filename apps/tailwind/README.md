## Tailwind

Utility-first CSS framework

---

- ✅ Loads of atomic classes/utilities
- ✅ Very minimal setup - just PostCSS + Tailwind!
- ✅ Same utility classes across multiple projects

---

- ❌ Need to learn syntax
- ❌ Sites can end up looking (same-y)[https://tailwindcss.com/showcase]
- ❌ Components cost $$
- ❌ Class names get long
